So I spent most of last night and a couple of hours this morning getting the basic framework of this running, but I think I've got the basic gameplay sorted.

I don't like the way the AI paddle moves, and theres most of the graphic elements (like a scoreboard, background etc missing). So I will probably work on things a little more to get those thing

Controls are W/S or UP/Down arrows to move the left paddle and the right paddle is AI controlled.

It should install by just running Setup.exe
